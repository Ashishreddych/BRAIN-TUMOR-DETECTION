Brain tumor detection involves various imaging techniques such as MRI, CT scans, and PET scans to identify abnormal growths in the brain. These techniques utilize advanced technology
to produce detailed images that allow medical professionals to visualize and analyze the size, location, and characteristics of the tumor. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence and 
machine learning algorithms are aiding in the automated detection and analysis of brain tumors, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis. 
Early detection is crucial for prompt treatment, improving patient outcomes and prognosis. Regular screening and advancements in imaging technology continue to enhance brain tumor detection methods.
